# tinybvh

Introducing tinybvh, a versatile and efficient library for bounding volume hierarchies that seamlessly integrates into custom game engine codebases.

After years of experience working with various custom game engine codebases, it became evident that many projects faced challenges when implementing spatial queries. Inadequate or hastily optimized solutions often made the codebase difficult to work with and maintain. Recognizing this common issue, tinybvh was developed as a non-intrusive solution, specifically designed to integrate smoothly into your existing code.

With its lightweight design and reliance solely on the STL, tinybvh can be easily incorporated into your custom game engine without disrupting your current architecture. This means you can benefit from the library's powerful spatial query capabilities without the need for extensive code modifications.

Whether you're working with a legacy game or a modern project, tinybvh's self-balancing structure and dynamic insertion and removal capabilities make it an ideal choice. It gracefully handles scenarios involving frequent object spawning and despawning, as well as a constantly moving camera. This adaptability allows you to seamlessly incorporate tinybvh into your game engine, catering to the dynamic nature of your game effortlessly.

tinybvh focuses on providing accurate and optimized queries while prioritizing rendering performance. By implementing a series of broad-phase steps and leveraging SIMD acceleration through a separating axis theorem test, the library ensures precise and efficient queries. This allows your game to render high-quality visuals while maintaining the responsiveness of critical queries.

With its minimal memory consumption, concurrent query support, and comprehensive range of query types, including frustum, ray, box, and convex hull queries, tinybvh empowers you to enhance your custom game engine with robust spatial query capabilities.

Discover the flexibility and efficiency of tinybvh as it seamlessly integrates into your custom game engine, providing accurate and efficient spatial queries without disrupting your existing code. Experience the benefits of a non-intrusive solution designed to optimize and streamline your game development workflow.
